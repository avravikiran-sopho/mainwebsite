Blockchain is a decentralized data base which is generally used as security for cryptocurrency bitcoin .To put it in simple words
its a way of storing and sharing information across a network of users in an open virtual space .In food for example a retailer
would knoow with whom his supplier has had dealings by simply scanning the QR code.
Blockchain makes a supply chain more transparent at an all-new level.It also empowers the entire chain to be more responsive to 
any food safety disorder massive organizations like Nestle and Unilever are considering blockchain technologies for that 
By using blockchain consumer can get information in 2.2 seconds.During an outbreak of contamination a company can save 
lifes using blockchain 
so i would like to conclude that blockchain is useful in many aspects so countries like india should embrace such kind pf
technologies
